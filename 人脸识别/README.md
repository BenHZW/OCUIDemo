# iOS-OpenCV-FaceRec

A small app demonstrating how OpenCV can be used on iOS to perform face recognition.

Please read objc.io issue 21 for the detailed description. 

##Installation: 

Assuming you already have [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) installed, you will also need [Cmake](https://cmake.org) in order to be able to build OpenCV locally. 

The easiest way to install Cmake is using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):

```
brew install cmake
```

After you have Cmake installed on your system, run `pod install` and go grab a coffee, it takes a while to build OpenCV.
